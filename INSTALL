How to install
--------------

libpedalog requires libusb and its headers to be installed.
It also requires cmake to be installed.

To install:

1) Go into libpedalog directory
2) cmake .

As root:
3) make install

This has been tested on Linux and Windows (using MinGW).

On Windows, the libusb-win32 driver must be installed to used this library: http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libusb-win32
