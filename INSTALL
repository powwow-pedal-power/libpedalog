How to install
--------------

libpedalog requires libusb and its headers to be installed.
It also requires cmake to be installed. In Debian variants,
this can be achieved using:

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libusb-dev

To install in Linux:

1) Go into libpedalog directory
2) cmake .
3) make

As root:
4) make install

This has been tested on Linux and Windows (using MinGW).
It should also work on Mac OS X but has not been tested yet.

On Windows, the libusb-win32 driver must be installed to used this library,
at least version 1.2.5:
